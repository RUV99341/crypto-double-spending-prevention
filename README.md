# Project Title: Prevention of Double Spending Problem in a Python-Based Cryptocurrency System with Real-Time Fraud Detection

## Project Goal
Design, develop, and implement a robust cryptocurrency system using Python that effectively prevents the double-spending problem and integrates a machine learning model for real-time fraud detection and user notification.

---

## Project Overview

This project replicates the core functionality of decentralized digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, with a specific focus on preventing the double-spending problem. Users can interact through a UI that supports wallet management, transaction initiation, and balance tracking.

A blockchain mechanism ensures transactional integrity, while a mining process (based on Proof-of-Work or similar consensus) validates transactions and secures the network.

The system introduces an innovative fraud detection layer, powered by machine learning, to proactively monitor transactions and user behavior for potential double-spending or malicious activities. Suspicious activity triggers real-time user notifications, enhancing financial security.
